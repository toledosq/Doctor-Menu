# Doctor-Menu
A simple terminal based C++ application for storing patient information.

This was my first personal project to help familiarize myself with classes and practice C++.

The application utilizes vectors to store patient information. There are several menus throughout the application
that allow users to add patients, remove patients, modify patient information, and view current patient information.

The application also automatically calculates a patient's BMI based off of their height and weight.

As of 12/8/2016, there are no constraints on information provided. This project was simply an experiment to see how
well I had retained my knowledge of C++ from university classes.
